### Notes ###

This lab works best when you make use of a proxy that will allow you to see the requests and responses. There are many you can use, but here are a few recommended ones:

- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/)
- [Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project)
- [Mitm Proxy](https://mitmproxy.org)
